how the memory program works:

starting:
./cpu program.code interrupt.code ---> reads the argument files into the array

this starts an input loop:
command address [data]

command 0 is read
command 1 is write, takes additional data argument
command -1 is exit

example i/o:
0 10 --> 19
1 10 1000
0 10 --> 1000
-1

can also be given as:
0 10 1 10 1000 0 10 -1 --> 19\n1000
